# ROTP Multiplayer — Session Handoff

Read this first when resuming the multiplayer work. It says where things stand,
how to run what exists, and exactly what to do next. The full design rationale is
in [`multiplayer-design.md`](multiplayer-design.md); this is the operational
"pick up here" note.

_Last updated: 2026-07-28, after per-empire notification delivery._

## Where we are

Branch **`multiplayer`** (off `master`). Phase 0 and most of Phase 1 are done and committed. The game is fully playable
**at the protocol level**: a headless server runs the real game, clients drive
every economic, military, expansion, spy, and diplomatic decision over
JSON/WebSocket, and each player receives per-empire notifications of what
happened each turn. What's missing is a real UI (the Java client is still a
minimal galaxy-map stub) and broader notification coverage.

Commits so far: `Phase 0`, `Phase I part 1`, `Phase 1 part 2`, `Phae 1 part 3`
(plus this test/handoff commit).

## Run it

```bash
# compile
mvn compile

# integration tests (headless, ~30s) — the safety net; run these after any change
mvn test

# play a local game: one server, then N clients
mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=cp.txt
java -cp "target/classes:$(cat cp.txt)" rotp.Rotp --server port=8777 players=2 size=small
java -cp "target/classes:$(cat cp.txt)" rotp.Rotp --client host=localhost port=8777 name=Alice

# classic offline single-player still works, unchanged
java -cp "target/classes:$(cat cp.txt)" rotp.Rotp
```

## What works (done + tested)

- **Headless engine** via the `SessionUI` seam; offline single-player unaffected.
- **We-go turns**: per-player `ready` flags; turn resolves when all are ready.
- **Fog-of-war `PlayerView`**: each client sees only what its empire knows.
- **Full player order set**, all server-validated for ownership/bounds/range:
  colony spending, research, fleet deploy, ship design (catalog/create/scrap/
  set-build), colonization, population transports, spy spending/missions,
  internal security, diplomacy (trade/peace/pact/alliance offers, treaty breaks,
  war) answered by the target's diplomat AI.
- **Control split** (`Empire.decidedByAI()` vs `isAIControlled()`): the server
  AI auto-resolves mid-turn prompts for everyone, but never overwrites a remote
  human's strategic orders. **This is the single most important invariant — when
  adding AI decision code, gate it on `decidedByAI()`, not `isAIControlled()`.**
- **Per-empire notifications**: the server generates each player's turn events
  itself (`rotp.mp.server.NotificationCenter`) by diffing that empire's state,
  rather than reusing ROTP's single-player notification classes. v1 covers first
  contact, diplomatic status changes, and colonies gained/lost.
- Verified by `itest/rotp/mp/` (4 tests): order/isolation, design/transport,
  spy/diplomacy (the last two also assert notification delivery).

## Do this next (in order)

1. **Port the real Swing screens to the protocol** (largest remaining item, and
   the thing standing between "playable at the protocol level" and "playable").
   Replace direct-model reads in the main/colony/fleet/tech/design/races screens
   with `PlayerView` DTOs, and wire their buttons to protocol commands instead of
   direct model mutation. The DTO/command surface built in Phase 1 is designed to
   cover the "core playable set" (galaxy map, colony spending, fleets/transports,
   tech, ship design, empire status). Do it screen by screen; keep the desktop
   single-player path working (the same panels still run against a local
   `GameSession` — consider a client-side view provider so panels don't care
   whether data came from the model or the wire).

2. **Extend notification coverage.** `NotificationCenter` currently diffs owned
   systems + contacts + treaty flags. Add snapshot fields + diff cases for
   tech completed, combat outcomes, spy reports, and GNN news. Note the one
   known gap: an empire met *via* a simultaneous war declaration reports only
   `CONTACT`, not the war (the war is still in `EmpireDto.atWar`).

Then Phase 2+ (reconnection, MP save/load, lobby race/color picks), Phase 3
(interactive mid-turn prompts with turn timers), Phase 4 (internet hosting),
Phase 5 (browser client). See design doc §7.

## Gotchas the tests and code already encode (don't relearn these the hard way)

- **Governor auto-rebalance trap.** ROTP's `AIGovernor.setColonyAllocations`
  human branch calls `baseSetPlayerAllocations` (a full rebalance) when a colony
  `hasNewOrders()`, has unallocated ticks, or awaits an allocation advisory. For
  remote humans it now fires only on unallocated ticks (new colonies). **Command
  handlers must never call `col.hasNewOrders(true)`** or wire orders get silently
  rewritten to AI patterns.
- **Auto-colonize.** Under server autoplay, a colony ship auto-settles a suitable
  planet on arrival (the colonize prompt auto-resolves). Deliberate v1 behavior;
  the explicit `colonize` command is for planets the AI declines.
- **Headless boot order.** Server init must mirror `RotPUI`'s data loading:
  `SessionUI.set(new ServerUI())` **first**, then `UserPreferences.load()`,
  `TechLibrary.current()`, `LanguageManager.current().selectedLanguageName()`
  (the lazy `languages()` call does the real label/race loading;
  `selectDefaultLanguage()` is a no-op trap). Encoded in `ServerMain` and
  `MpTestSupport.bootEngine()`.
- **Small hulls are tight.** A MOO1 nuclear bomb doesn't fit a small hull with
  default fittings — tests use a medium hull. Not a bug.
- **Unseeded RNG.** `Base.random` is unseeded, so galaxy geometry and contact
  timing vary run to run. Geography-dependent test paths use JUnit assumptions to
  skip (not fail). Seeding the RNG for deterministic tests is a worthwhile future
  task and would also enable lockstep-style verification.

## Where things live

- `src/rotp/mp/protocol/` — `Protocol` (envelope/registry), `Messages`, `PlayerView`.
- `src/rotp/mp/server/` — `ServerMain`, `GameServer` (lobby + commands + turn driver),
  `PlayerViews` (DTO builder), `NotificationCenter` (per-empire event diffing),
  `ServerUI` (headless `SessionUI`).
- `src/rotp/mp/client/` — `NetClient`, `ClientMain`, `GalaxyViewPanel` (stub UI).
- `itest/rotp/mp/` — integration tests + `MpTestSupport` harness.
- Engine seams: `rotp.model.game.SessionUI`; `Empire.decidedByAI/isRemoteHuman`;
  moved statics in `Rotp` (scaling, debug file) and `GameSession` (pending options).
